							Of course, because it’s SRB2Kart, it has a Sonic twist that really shows the classic charm
							that a lot of us know and love from the good old days™.
							
							We have 100 jam-packed maps for you to bump, explode, and sparkle your way through, from
							luscious beaches, to Eggman’s dance floor, to England on a good day. All lovingly crafted
							by many different people. You’ll notice almost every aspect of the game has an immense love
							and inspiration from the classic sonic games. From the items such as Ballhog, which literally
							throws bouncey explodey balls at people, to the maps which are bursting with that Sonic feel.
