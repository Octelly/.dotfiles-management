summary:			The Free Software Media System
description:	Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in
							control of managing and streaming your media. It is an
							alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide
							media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via
							multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2
							release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full
							cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no
							premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a
							team who want to build something better and work together to
							achieve it. We welcome anyone who is interested in joining us
							in our quest!
